Annotation Model Test Results
=============================

Placeholder for annotation-model test results. Once some results are available, the 
implementation report will be available at 

* http://w3c.github.io/test-results/annotation-model/all.html

To add new tests results:

1. Produce a set of JSON test result files using http://w3c-test.org/tools/runner/index.html (or a local copy)
2. For the test-results repo if you haven't already (https://github.com/w3c/test-results)
3. Place your new .json results in the annotation-model directory
4. Create a pull request with your updated file
5. When it is merged the maintainers will update the overall results report automatically (https://w3c.github.io/test-results/annotation-protocol/all.html)

If you want to see what the report would look like locally, use the wptreport tool (https://github.com/spec-ops/wptreport) to build a 
report with a command line like `wptreport -f -m -s "Annotation Model"`

Annotation Vocabulary Test Results
==================================

Placeholder for annotation-vocabulary test results.  Once some results are available, the
implementation report will be available at

* http://w3c.github.io/test-results/annotation-model/vocab-results.html
