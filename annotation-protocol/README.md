Annotation Protocol Test Results
=============================

Placeholder for annotation-protocol test results. Once some results are available, the 
implementation report will be available at 

* `http://w3c.github.io/test-results/annotation-protocol/all.html`

To add new tests results:

1. Select a two letter abbreviation for your implementation under test (e.g., AB)
2. Produce a JSON test result files using http://w3c-test.org/tools/runner/index.html (or a local copy); naming that file using the two letter abbreviation and a two digit representation of the version number under test.
3. For the test-results repo if you haven't already (https://github.com/w3c/test-results)
4. Place your new .json results in the annotation-protocol directory
5. Create a pull request with your updated file
6. When it is merged the maintainers will update the overall results report automatically (https://w3c.github.io/test-results/annotation-model/all.html)
